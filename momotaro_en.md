# Momotaro

Once upon a time, there lived an old man and an old woman. The old man went to the mountains to cut grass, and the old woman went to the river to do laundry.

While the old woman was washing clothes in the river, she felt as if a large peach came floating down the stream. The old woman picked up the peach and took it to the palace.

When the old man and the old woman cut open the peach, a lively boy jumped out from inside. They named the boy "Momotaro" and raised him with care.

Momotaro grew up and decided to go on a quest to defeat the demons. The old woman made dumplings for Momotaro to take with him. Along the way, a dog, a monkey, and an eagle joined him, and they headed to Demon Island.

On Demon Island, Momotaro and his companions worked together to defeat the demons and brought back treasures. The old man and the old woman were very happy, and everyone lived happily ever after.

The end.
